      A short story is a shard, a sliver, a vignette. It’s a biopsy on the human
      condition but it doesn’t have this capacity to think autonomously for
      itself. ~Will Self
    </p>
    <p>Definitions:</p>
    <p>First Person</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I, me, my</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Should be both a character in, and narrator of, the story</p>
      </li>
      <li>

          Can observe all the characters but can only reveal what he is thinking
          or feeling himself.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Second Person</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The narrator tells only what this character sees and feels, and cannot
          see into other character’s heads (do not head-hop!)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Third Person, Limited</p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Simply a narrator</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Not part of the story and cannot read anyone’s mind</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Think of a newspaper article</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Third Person, Omniscient</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>He, him , his</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The “God-narrator”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Narrator/Author knows all and sees all and often intrudes on the story
          with own opinions and judgements
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In a short story, it is best to choose one viewpoint, and one viewpoint
      character (usually, the protagonist) and stick to it throughout. The space
      simply does not allow for multiple viewpoints of multiple viewpoint
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>Tenses</p>
    <p>
      We write most stories in the simple past tense. (He walked. She gasped. We
      laughed.) It is the most commonly used of all the tenses in fiction
      because it works well.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we suggest you also try the present tense. It is immediately
      involving and enables you to manipulate the reader into feeling and
      experiencing the story in real-time.
    </p>
    <p>The key, again, is consistency.</p>
    <h1>Exercise 14 – Viewpoint</h1>
    <p>
      Write a scene, or choose one you have already written. Identify which
      viewpoint you used. Rewrite it in a different viewpoint.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 15 – Tenses</h1>
    <p>
      Write a scene, or choose one you have already written. Identify which
      tense you used. Rewrite it using a different tense.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 16 – Decisions, decisions</h1>
    <p>Look at your planning so far.</p>
    <p>
      Decide which narrative tense you are going to use, as well as which kind
      of viewpoint would suit your story best.
