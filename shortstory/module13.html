      I believe that the short story is as different a form from the novel as
      poetry is, and the best stories seem to me to be perhaps closer in spirit
      to poetry than to novels. ~Tobias Wolff

    <p>
      With a novel, which takes perhaps years to write, the author is not the
      same man he was at the end of the book as he was at the beginning. It is
      not only that his characters have developed—he has developed with them,
      and this nearly always gives a sense of roughness to the work: a novel can
      seldom have the sense of perfection which you find in Chekhov’s story, The
      Lady with the Dog. ~Graham Greene

    <p>The ending should always:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Take us to the point where the story goal is achieved (or not).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Show whatever change your main character has undergone as a result of
          the conflict.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Satisfy the reader.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Sometimes the best short stories are the ones that leave you guessing, so
      do not be afraid to create a bit of mystery in your conclusion but make
      sure the story feels finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip: Do not work in an artificial twist in the end, unless the story
      justifies it. Do not impose yourself and force the story in a direction.
      Sit back, look at the story, and think what could or should be the most
      logical and most natural outcome, given the characters involved. Do not
      make them do things they would not naturally do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to write a story that leaves your reader looking for your name
      at the end
