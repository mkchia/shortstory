      I find it satisfying and intellectually stimulating to work with the
      intensity, brevity, balance and word play of the short story. ~Annie
      Proulx
    </p>
    <p>
      After you have written your story, put it away for a week or two. Do
      something else. Distract yourself and resist the temptation to read it
      again. Then the refinement starts. Take of your writer’s hat and put on
      your editor’s glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      All good writing is re-writing; that means 1% talent and 99% hard work.
      When you reread your work, keep the following most common mistakes in
      mind:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Adverbs – most ‘ly’ adverbs add nothing. Rather use strong verbs.
          Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Stepped softly – tiptoed</p></li>
          <li><p>Moved quickly – raced</p></li>
          <li><p>Looked carefully – inspected</p></li>
          <li><p>Said softly – whispered</p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Passive voice - cut this out. It destroys pacing. 
          Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The biscuit was eaten by the boy. - The boy ate the biscuit.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Tom was told to shut up by Mr Jones. – “Be quiet, Tom,’ said Mr
              Jones.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Indirect verbs. Take out every ‘was’, ‘were’ and ‘will be’. Only use
          these if you need to use the verb, to be. 
          Examples
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>was walking – walked.</p></li>
          <li><p>were dancing – danced.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you use adjectives, make them work for you or leave them out.
          Examples
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>He owned a Mercedes – NOT – He owned an expensive German car.</p></a></li>
          <li><p>He owned a Pit Bull Terrier – NOT – He owned a vicious dog.</p></a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>
        Write in the simple past. First time authors tend to have ‘had’ attacks for some reason. 
        Example: She had eaten too much – She ate too much.</p></li>
      <li><p>Insert dialogue whenever you can.
      Facts</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>It helps with showing versus telling</p></li>
          <li><p>It reduces author intrusion.</p></li>
          <li><p>Modern novels and memoirs contain 50 – 70% dialogue.</p></li>
          <li><p>It moves a story along.</p></li>
          <li><p>It shows a character’s thought processes and his or her background.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><p>Very little ‘white space’. This refers to writing that consists of dense blocks of narrative. It usually has endless descriptions and overly long sentences.</p></li>
      <li><p>Silly mistakes.
          Examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>She thought to herself (Who else is she going to think to?)</p></li>
              <li><p>He shrugged his shoulders (What else can he shrug?)</p></li>
              <li><p>He stood up (How else is he going to stand?)</p></li>
              <li><p>She sat down (How else is she going to sit?)</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      <li><p>9. Modifiers & Qualifiers.
          Leave out the following padding words:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>every</p></li>
            <li><p>almost</p></li>
            <li><p>nearly</p></li>
            <li><p>quite</p></li>
            <li><p>very</p></li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><p>Remove unnecessary conjunctions like ‘as’, ‘and’, ‘but’ and ‘then’. Ask yourself why you are creating such a long sentence. Perhaps you should be starting a new sentence instead.</p></li>
      <li><p>Leave out the dreaded – “started to’’ or began to’’ or “suddenly”
Events happen in chronological order.</p></li>
      <li><p>Common misuse of viewpoint writing when an author is using the five senses.</p>
          <p>Examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>She heard the knocking at the door. No! Knock. Knock. She looked up. Yes!</p></li>
            <li><p>He smelled the scent of her French perfume. No! Chanel No 5 drifted across the room. He smiled and turned to face her. Yes!</p></li>
            <li><p>Sarah saw the child run across the street. No! Julie ran across the street. Sarah hoped that the child’s mother knew where she was. Yes!</p></li>
            <li><p>Simon felt the cushions as he sat down on the couch. No! Simon eased into the plump cushions on the couch. Yes!</p></li>
            <li><p>Moya tasted the ripe mango. No! The mango dripped like honey on Moya’s tongue. She bit into the sweet flesh.</p></li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A muddled or shifting viewpoint. Do not head hop. It confuses readers.</p>
        <p>Incorrect example is written from mixed viewpoints.</p>
        <p>Why are you in a bad mood?” Victoria asked.</p>
        <p>She knew this would irritate him even more, but a familiar devil spurred her on.</p>
        <p>“I’m not in a bad mood.” Dave glared at her, hating the narrow curve of her mouth under its gloss of crimson lipstick</p>
        <p>“Yes, you are.”</p>
        <p>Victoria wanted a fight to clear the air after the long argument the previous night. Dave, on the other hand, wanted to avoid one at all costs.</p>
        <p>What’s wrong? We are in two different heads in one scene.</p>
        <p>Correct example:</p>
        <p>Victoria glared at her husband across the breakfast table. He was wearing his blue silk dressing gown, his face still flushed with sleep.</p>
        <p>“Why are you in such a bad mood this morning?”</p>
        <p>She knew this would irritate him even more, but a familiar devil spurred her on.</p>
        <p>Dave glared at her. “I’m not in a bad mood.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, you are.”</p>
        <p>She wanted a fight, to clear the air after a long argument the night before.</p>
      <li><p>Leave out most of your commas.</p></li>
    </ol>
