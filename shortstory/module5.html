    <p>The Chicken Or The Egg?</p>
    <p>Women want love to be a novel, men a short story. ~Daphne du Maurier</p>
    <p>
      Stories are born in one of two ways, neither of which is the right or the
      wrong way.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Some stories come to you first as an idea for a plot, but without
          characters. The goal is then to populate the idea with believable
          characters. Notice we do not say 'real' characters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Some stories come to you first as an interesting character, but
          without a story. The goal is then to explore who this character is and
          find out what his or her story might be.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Some writers divide authors into these two categories: 'plot-driven'
      authors, such as Stephen King (Carrie, It) or James Patterson (Alex Cross
      novels), and 'character-driven' authors, such as Janet Fitch (White
      Oleander) or Toni Morrison (Beloved).
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not matter how the story is born and shaped, as long as it becomes
      a story. However, for this exercise and just for fun, we will start
      with...
    </p>
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things to get right in writing is to make your
      characters believable. That means that they should seem recognisably human
      in the ways in which they act, think and speak – unless they are aliens,
      of course.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Characters drive the storyline.</p></li>
      <li><p>Characters act and speak differently.</p></li>
      <li><p>Characters do things for specific reasons.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In order to get this right, you need to know your character extremely
      well, which simply means that you need to explore, think about and decide
      on every aspect of that character’s life. This involves their personality,
      hopes, dreams, and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing a short story, your time and space is limited, though. This
      means you need to be selective. Not every aspect you have thought about
      will eventually make it onto the page, but the more aspects you think
      about, the more alive the character will be in your imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      His or her environment defines a character and the environment will, in
      turn define the character. Keep this in mind when you create him or her.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 7 – The character</h1>
    <p>
      Go back to your newspaper story title or use any scene you have written
      for any of the exercises.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Who is the protagonist in this situation? To whom does everything
          happen? If it is not clear, pick someone as your main character who
          might be centrally involved in the playing out of the events described
          in the story, and work with him or her.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If he or she does not have a name, pick one for him or her. You can
          change the name if you do not like the original. Write the name on top
          of a blank page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now draw a large stick figure on the page. Make notes of the
          character’s physique, from hair colour to shoe size.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Answer the following seven questions about him or her: (Write a short
          paragraph on each question. Be as fresh, quirky, original, and
          interesting as you can be. Do not pick the obvious or the ordinary.
          Your character must be unique and fresh. Push yourself. Think.)
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li><p>Who were his or her childhood friends?</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Did he or she have a favourite pet? What was it? Give it a name.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>He loved his father or mother more because…</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The character wanted a ………………….. for his or her birthday when he
              or she was 12. Did he or she get it?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>He or she wished his or her name was …………………………….</p></li>
          <li><p>He or she wanted to be a ………………when he or she grew up.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the one secret this character would never tell anyone?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Exercise 8 – The other character</h1>
    <p>Now pick another character.</p>
    <p>
      This should be someone already in the scene or if your character is alone
      try to create another character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do the same process with this character – from the physical to the
      psychological. Do not worry about how he or she will be involved in the
      story just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may give your imagination free reign. Again, make original choices,
      and – if you can – try to create as big a contrast as possible with your
      protagonist.
    </p>
    <p>This character will become your opposition character.</p>
