      If you look at my last songs and first short stories, there is a real
      connection between them. ~Kazuo Ishiguro

      Every competition and publisher will have its own preferred method for
      receiving short stories, and prescriptions for how it should look.
      However, the basics usually stay the same:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Always use Times New Roman, or Courier, in 12 point font size,
          double-spacing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Title and author’s name on the front page, plus as header on each
          subsequent page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Number all pages in sequence.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Type: 'The End' in the middle of the page, on the last page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Never bind a manuscript in any way. You may choose to put a rubber
          band around it, but no staples or holes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Best is to courier an entry. They do get lost in the mail. Otherwise,
          registered mail, so that you have proof you mailed it on time.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Although these are good guidelines, check with the publishers. Details may
      differ. Get it right.
    </p>
    <p>Publishers:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          First, look at their already published books and editors. Do they
          accept short stories in the first place? Ensure that you have the
          correct Submissions Editor’s name. If not, find out what it is.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Send a query letter tailor-made to the publisher and editor you have
          selected. Do not forget to mention your experience and the fact that
          you have attended a Writers Write workshop.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Competitions:</p>
    <p>
      Enter as many competitions as you can. It is a foot in the door, and the
      deadline will force you to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip: Ask to be subscribed to Writers Write web updates. You will receive
      daily writing articles, literary birthdays, news of competitions, writing
      quotes, and writing prompts.
