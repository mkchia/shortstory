    <h1>Module 15 - Dialogue: Who Said What To Whom?</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
    <p>
      I used to write things for friends. There was this girl I had a crush on,
      and she had a teacher she didn’t like at school. I had a real crush on
      her, so almost every day I would write her a little short story where she
      would kill him in a different way. ~Stephen Colbert

    <p>
      Direct speech, or dialogue, will help you solve the show-versus-tell
      problem, because dialogue dramatizes situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dialogue is a tool. Use it to increase pace, to describe personalities, to
      show their reactions and actions, and to colour your story.
    </p>
    <p>Check that your dialogue achieves one of the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Reveals something about the character.</p></li>
      <li><p>Shows something about another character.</p></li>
      <li><p>Describes the situation.</p></li>
      <li><p>Gives necessary background information.</p></li>
      <li><p>Sets a mood or tone.</p></li>
      <li><p>Leads to the next step in the story.</p></li>
      <li><p>Adds another element to the plot.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>What is a dialogue tag?</p>
    <p>
      Dialogue tags tell us when a character is speaking. They are every ‘he
      said’ and ‘she said’ in the books you read. Use them. Readers do not like
      to be confused and you do not want them to lose interest and stop reading.
      Do not add adverbs to these tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip: When there are only two characters in a scene, place the dialogue
      tags for each one in the first natural breaks after they speak. You can
      choose to describe actions, thoughts, and expressions without the tags
      after you’ve done this – as long as there is no confusion about who is
      speaking. However, always use the tags when there are three or more
      characters involved.

    <h1>Exercise 23 – Talk about it</h1>
    <p>Just dialogue</p>
    <p>
      Write a scene between your protagonist and antagonist consisting of mostly
      of dialogue. You do not have to use this scene in the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The antagonist’s intentions and motivations for opposing your lead should
      become clear in this interaction.
