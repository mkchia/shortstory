    <p>Short fiction seems more targeted - hand grenades of ideas, if you will. When they work, they hit, they explode, and you never forget them. Long fiction feels more like atmosphere: it’s a lot smokier and less defined. ~Paolo Bacigalupi</p>
    <p>Your opening scene must immediately intrigue the reader to want to know more. The beginnings must:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Catch the reader’s attention through action</p></li>
      <li><p>Draw the reader into your character’s world, establish the tone and</p></li>
      <li><p>Contain the inciting moment.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>The idea is to create enough excitement so that the reader wants to read on.</p>
    <h1>Exercise 17 – The beginning</h1>
    <p>The opening scene</p>
    <p>With the above in mind, write the opening scene of your short story. Choose one of the story ideas you came up with earlier or try a new idea.</p>
    <p>Launch it with action. What happens? Is it comical? Is it serious?
      <ol>
        <li><p>Create drama. Be as busy and descriptive as possible. Use colours, noise, action and particularly, dialogue. Do not use flashbacks here. Forget about back-story. Show, show, show as if it is happening in front of you on a big screen.</p></li>
        <li><p>Do not introduce the antagonist in the scene yet. Let the conflict grow naturally from the events you dramatize, that is, from surrounding smaller characters.</p></li>
        <li><p>Do not give us the protagonist’s decision or goal yet. He has no time to think or decide. He acts.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don’t worry too much about the rules right now. This is the first draft. Get the story on the paper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once you are done try to identify: the goal, conflict and disaster.</p></li>
      </ol>
