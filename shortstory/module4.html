    <h1>Module 4 - Where Do Ideas For Stories Come From?</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
    <p>
      Somewhere around the place I’ve got an unfinished short story about
      Schrodinger’s Dog; it was mostly moaning about all the attention the cat
      was getting. ~Terry Pratchett
    </p>
    <p>The true writer’s philosophy:</p>
    <p>Do not trust the muse. He or she is too flighty and temperamental.</p>
    <p>
      Rather open your eyes and ears to what happens around you. Ideas are
      everywhere. Switch on that automatic recorder in the back of your head.
      Stories are around us, every day, everywhere. The art lies in recognising
      and remembering them as little sparks for creative exploration.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Personal experience. Have you witnessed, experienced, or read about, a
          dramatic event? Have you had an encounter with an intriguing person?
          Were you jilted? Has something or somebody repulsed you? Did someone
          sell you a used car that you had to return? Was your pet killed in a
          car accident? How did that make you feel? What did you do?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Social issues. Are there social issues that anger or intrigue you?
          Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Men who are paid more than women to do the same job.</li>
          <li>
            The government’s lack of concern about the safety of its citizens.
          </li>
          <li>Unfair laws.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          How would you dramatize an incident relating to this issue? Which kind
          of characters would experience these issues first-hand?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What if… Play a game and imagine what could wrong, or right, for every
          scenario of your day. Think in opposites, swop gender roles, think of
          the worst thing that could happen and then of the best thing that
          could happen. Imagine a giant octopus climbing out of the ocean.
          Imagine your boss running through boss butt naked after he gets fired.
          Have fun and then write it down.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Think about themes. Examples: Work versus home; a woman in a man’s world;
      the more things change the more they stay the same.
    </p>
    <h2>Three Golden Rules of Writing:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write Every Day. Set up a writing routine and stick to it. Writing is
          a job. Make deadlines and stick to them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write What You Love To Read. There is no sense in writing a luscious
          love story if you do not believe in it yourself. Always try to imagine
          that someone else has written this story – would you pick it up and
          read it? Or would you ignore it from the beginning?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Write Because You Have No Choice. It is all good and well to want to
          win prizes, but accolades and money are never the best driving forces
          behind good writing. Writing is a craft; it takes time, patience and
          practise, often for very little actual reward. If this deters you from
          wanting to do it, stop now.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Exercise 6 - Ideas</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Personal Experience: Write a scene about something that happened to
          you or that you saw. It can be funny, sad, scary. Anything you can
          thing of.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Social Issues:</p>
        <p>
          a) Read news stories in popular newspapers or websites. Pick one that
          interests or intrigues you the most, or one that deals with an issue
          you feel strongly about. React impulsively or viscerally. Do not think
          about why you’ve chosen it too much. Just pick one.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) Circle a single keyword in the story you have chosen (not a name or
          a place) that occurs most, or that summarises the gist of the story
          for you, or that tickles your imagination. Again, react viscerally. Do
          not think too much.
        </p>
        <p>c) Brainstorm! Spider-Chart! Colours! Connections!</p>
        <p>
          d)Come up with a title for a story from your brainstorm: not a title
          for a newspaper article, but a title for a short story. Something that
          would make a potential reader stop and wonder what this is about. Be
          quirky. Be original. Have fun. Nothing is too weird or too strange.
        </p>
        <p>
          e) Write the story. Don’t worry about what it should or shouldn’t be
          or what the rules are. Just get it down so that you have something to
          edit later.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          What if… a. Write down three things that you did today. Bought
          groceries, typed an email etc. b. Now think in opposites or of
          anything crazy. What is weirdest, worst, funniest thing could happen?
          c. Write the scene.
