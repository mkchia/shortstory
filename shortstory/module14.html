    <h1>Module 14 - Settings And Descriptions: The What And The Where</h1>

    <p>
      The short story is still like the novel’s wayward younger brother, we know
      that it’s not respectable - but I think that can also add to the glory of
      it. ~Neil Gaiman
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take a step back from what we have done so far. When you wrote the
      first two parts of your story, how much attention did you pay to
      description and setting?
    </p>
    <p>Good description always includes the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The use of all five senses.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>A few original figures of speech, such as metaphors and similes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A selection of details to establish the tone or mood weaved into the
          scene when it’s necessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Colourful language created by using specific nouns and active verbs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The omission of superfluous adjectives and adverbs.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Varied sentence structures: Shorter sentences and fragments create
          pace. Longer sentences slow us down.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Less is more, is better.</p>
    <h1>Exercise 21 – Examine</h1>
    <p>
      Look at the stories we read at the beginning. Examine them in terms of the
      6 points above.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 22 – Review and rewrite</h1>
    <p>Review and add, if necessary, setting and description.</p>
