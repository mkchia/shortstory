    <h1>Module 2 - Introduction: What Is A Short Story?</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
    <p>
      A short story is a love affair; a novel is a marriage. A short story is a
      photograph; a novel is a film. ~Lorrie Moore
    </p>
    <h2>What is a short story?</h2>
    <p>
      The simplest answer is that it is exactly that: short. It should have an
      impact and a meaning, and it should be memorable.
    </p>
    <p>How long should my short story be?</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The short-short story is around 1 000 to 1 500 words</p></li>
      <li><p>The short story is 2 000 to 5 000 words or longer</p></li>
      <li><p>The novella is 30 000 to 60 000 words</p></li>
      <li><p>The average novel is 80 000 words</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Anything under 1000 words is considered flash fiction.</p>
    <p>
      These are guidelines, and the length is determined by the story itself. A
      better description of a short story is an account of an incident. It
      usually contains:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>a single main character (protagonist)</p></li>
      <li><p>a simple plot structure</p></li>
      <li><p>a clear beginning, middle, climax and end</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There is usually no sub-plot, and some of the secondary characters are
      one-dimensional. However, we create a multi-dimensional main character who
      undergoes a change in the course of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main character in the beginning of the story should not be entirely
      the same person at the end. Something happens. Something changes. He or
      she gains an insight or changes direction. The person grows or weakens
      because of a dramatic event.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal with the modern short story is to keep it fast-paced, with
      original striking descriptions or imagery, sparsely and cleverly applied.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 3 – Show the change</h1>
    <p>
      Write a short piece, using the prompt: The difference is, I grew up…Use
      the method describe in Exercise 2. Write for 7 minutes. Focus on the
      character and the change and the difference.
