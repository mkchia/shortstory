    <h1>Module 8 - Plot Plan: A Recipe That Works</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
    <p>
      A short story must have a single mood and every sentence must build
      towards it. ~Edgar Allan Poe
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you have thought about story goals, and scenes and sequels, let
      us look at the overall structure again. We said that we need a clear
      beginning, a middle, and an end, but we would like to equip you with a
      slightly more refined plot recipe, which you could use repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note: this is not the only way to plan and write a short story.
      There are probably as many methods and plot structures out there as there
      are writers and stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this recipe works. If you follow this structure carefully, you
      will have a completed, rounded story with all the necessary elements.
    </p>
    <p>It is as simple as this....</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Dramatic Start (Scene)</p></li>
      <li><p>Decisive Sequel</p></li>
      <li><p>Surprising Middle (Scene)</p></li>
      <li><p>Satisfying End (Scene)</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Before we explore these four parts, there are still a couple of technical
      aspects to discuss.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 13 - Experiment</h1>
    <p>
      Rewrite your opening scene in the opposite. Experiment: change the gender
      of you protagonist, choose the most way-out setting.
