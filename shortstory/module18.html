      I’m a failed poet. Maybe every novelist wants to write poetry first, finds
      he can’t and then tries the short story which is the most demanding form
      after poetry. And failing at that, only then does he take up novel
      writing. ~William Faulkner

      We have reached the end of this course. Now it is up to you to write,
      write and rewrite your stories. Writing is an art we spend our whole lives
      trying to master. Some days will be great, the writing will flow. Other
      days will be a disastrous with one blank page after another, but if you
      show up every day those days will come around less often.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Write every day</p>
        <p>
          This is still the best advice. Athletes, artists and musicians
          practice and practice and then they start again. Writers are no
          different.

        <p>
          Keep it exciting. Try new prompts, change viewpoint, tense and gender
          roles.</p> <p>Keep monotony at bay by using as much variety as possible.</p>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enter competitions</p>
        <p>Competitions have deadlines. We’re writers we need those.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Set goals and deadlines</p>
