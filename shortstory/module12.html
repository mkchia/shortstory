      My short stories are like soft shadows I have set out in the world, faint
      footprints I have left. I remember exactly where I set down each and every
      one of them, and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like guideposts
      to my heart… ~Haruki Murakami

      The core of your story is where most of the central conflict takes place
      between the protagonist and the antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, try to show us a different, surprising aspect of your main
      character too. Which aspect could we never have guessed? Consider
      revealing it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember this could mean anything unexpected, from shock, horror or
      disgust, to unexpected sympathy or emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: If you’ve set the story in a work environment, show us what his
      or her home looks like. Who shares it with the character? How does this
      detail surprise us?
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it calls for a dramatic shift in tone:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your start was humorous, how about introducing a surprising dark
          element?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your start was serious, how could you write this part humorously?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
