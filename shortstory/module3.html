    <h1>Module 3 - Reading Critically: What Is A Good Short Story?</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
    <p>
      A short story is a different thing all together - a short story is like a
      kiss in the dark from a stranger. ~Stephen King
    </p>
    <p>
      We write what we read, so if we want to write short stories we have to
      read short stories. You must learn to read like a writer. Choose a short
      story, read it and answer the answer the questions below.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 4 - Read a short story.</h1>
    <h1>Discuss the following aspects.</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><p>you enjoy the story? Why?</p></li>
      <li><p>What effect did it have on you? Write a paragraph.</p></li>
      <p>After youâ€™ve completed this, identify the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Who is the main character?</p></li>
        <li><p>From whose viewpoint is the story told?</p></li>
        <li><p>What incident creates a story goal?</p></li>
        <li><p>What is the climax of the story?</p></li>
        <li><p>Has the main character changed?</p></li>
        <li><p>Did you like the descriptions and attention to detail?</p></li>
        <li><p>What did you think of the characterisation?</p></li>
        <li><p>What did you think of the dialogue?</p></li>
        <li><p>What did you think of the humour, if any?</p></li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          After thinking about these, is your evaluation of the story the same?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Exercise 5 - Read another short story.</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><p>In which ways does it differ from the first?</p></li>
      <li><p>Did you like it more, or less?</p></li>
      <li><p>Why?</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Repeat this exercise for every short story you read in future. The more
      you read, the more you will learn.
