    <h1>Module 6 - Story Goals: The Reasons Why</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
    <p>
      A good [short story] would take me out of myself and then stuff me back
      in, outsized, now, and uneasy with the fit. ~David Sedaris
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you start writing, it is a good idea to plan your story. All good
      stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The conventional plot plan
      dictates that you have an opening scene, which contains the inciting
      moment. This moment is inciting because it sparks the action of the story
      and it sets things in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inciting moment also causes the protagonist to make a decision or set
      a goal. He embarks on a new path, which will eventually lead him to
      change, whether he realises this or not.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 9 – Identify the moment</h1>
    <p>
      Look back at the stories you read and try to identify the inciting moment.
      This would be the incident that creates the story goal in Exercise 4.
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 10 – Moment of change</h1>
    <p>
      Return to your protagonist and the scene you decided to use, and answer
      the following question:
    </p>
    <p>
      If the event described in the story was an inciting moment for my
      protagonist, what does he decide to do differently? What does he want
      because of this decision? What is his goal?
    </p>
    <p>My protagonist’s goal is to...</p>
    <p>
      Of course, a certain character might want to oppose this path of change in
      the main character for various reasons. This character is called the
      antagonist. Who is the other character you created in Exercise 8?
    </p>
    <p>
      He or she is the key source of conflict in the storyline. The antagonist
      could be anybody from a jealous spouse, a false friend, a worried doctor,
      an angry boss, a police officer, to an overprotective parent. This should
      be a person who has a good reason to want the protagonist to stay the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      No story can exist without conflict, and conflict comes from opposing
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip: Antagonists are not necessarily evil. In fact, and in order to create
      believable antagonists, their motivations must be just as valid and
      reasonable in objecting to or resisting the main character’s new path of
      action
    </p>
    <h1>Exercise 11 – Create the conflict</h1>
    <p>
      Return to the secondary character you have planned. This is your
      antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>Answer the following questions:</p>
    <p>
      What is the relationship between this antagonist and your protagonist?
    </p>
    <p>
      <p>Complease the following:</p>
      The reason why (blank) (antagonist) wants to oppose or resist (blank)'s
      (protagonist) decision to (blank) is because he or she (blank).
