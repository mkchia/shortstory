    <h1>Module 11 - Decisive Sequel: Someone Decides To Do Something</h1>

    <p>
      My highest point was the first thing I won, a short story competition in a
      women’s magazine in the Eighties. It was the first time I’d had my writing
      validated, and the first thing I’d ever shown anyone else. ~Kate Atkinson

    <h1>Exercise 18 - Sequel</h1>
    <p>Now write the sequel to the scene you’ve written.</p>
    <p>
      You need to help your character deal with the emotional turmoil you
      created in the beginning. Allow the decision that the main character makes
      here to be his/her overall story goal.
    </p>
    <p>Follow the steps of Sequel closely:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Emotion</p></li>
      <li><p>Quandary</p></li>
      <li><p>Decision</p></li>
      <li><p>(the beginning of the next) action</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      End it here. The moment the character begins acting again, you are in the
      next scene.
