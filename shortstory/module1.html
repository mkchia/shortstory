    <h1>Module 1 - Top Ten Reasons to Write Short Stories</h1>
    <p><a href="../index.html">Back to Home</a></p>

    <p>
      The great thing about a short story is that it doesn’t have to trawl
      through someone’s whole life; it can come in glancingly from the side.
      ~Emma Donoghue

    <p>
      Some of the finest pieces of fiction are short stories. Reading a short
      story takes a short while, but you may remember it forever. Can you think
      of any you’ve enjoyed?
    </p>

    <p>Some of Stephen King and Roald Dahl’s best work is short fiction.</p>

    <p>
      Owing to their limited length and simple dramatic structure, many short
      stories lend themselves to transformation into film. Stephen King’s Rita
      Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption became Tim Robbins’ The Shawshank
      Redemption starring Morgan Freeman.

        <p>
          <span>Practice.</span> Short stories are an excellent way to develop a
          story with a beginning, middle, and ending. They are also easier to
          finish than novels.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Cellular world.</span> Readers have smaller screens and shorter
          attention spans. You may reach a different market with your short
          stories. Literary journals, online journals, and consumer magazines,
          which are often read online, publish short stories.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Publish on the Internet.</span> Short stories are a great way to
          write for the Internet. You starting a blog and posting instalments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>A way to start.</span> Many great writers started by writing
          short stories. Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, and Mark Twain became
          famous novelists, but they honed their craft publishing short stories.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Experiment.</span> A short story is a good way to try a
          different genre without putting 80 000 words, which have to be
          revised, rewritten and reworked, on paper. You may find that your
          voice is suited to a completely different type of story.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Reputation.</span> Short stories are a good way to help you
          build up a body of work. This shows publishers that you are a working
          writer. Fiction magazines that publish short stories are often read by
          reviewers, publishers, and editors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Competitions.</span> Entering short story contests could
          jump-start your career. Winning a prestigious competition, or having a
          story included in an anthology, is good for your resume and your ego.
          You may even win some money. You also get feedback on entries in some
          competitions. This is almost unheard of when you submit novels today.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>Concentrate.</span> Short stories force you to get to the point.
          The lack of sub-plots, as well as a limited number of characters,
          makes it easier to concentrate on the plot. This is good for writers
          who need to stop filling their novels with back-story.

          <span>Nobel.</span> Alice Munro, a short story writer, won the 2013
          Nobel Prize for Literature.
